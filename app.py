This is the summary of my Self-Study Journey, **after** I've attained my Master's degree (2017).

My study methodology involves using the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), with the use of noise cancelling headphones, along with some good old [static noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcWgjCDPiP4) or deep ambient music. Long time follower of [deep work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692). üë®üèª‚Äçüíª üéß ‚òï

The data below consists mainly of books and personal development of code libraries that I use in my day-to-day life.

Last update of data was on {df_max_date:%Y-%m-%d}.

These study hours were converted into massive dividends, whether through time/money that was saved, or through the delivery of high quality Reports. But, studying for me personally is so much more than that. I've achieved personal growth by understanding the value of discipline/sacrifice and time (*why, oh why does day only last 24 hours?*). We live in an amazing world that is full of hidden gold nuggets. It is up to us to find them, and to prepare ourselves for the challenges that are ahead of us.""")
